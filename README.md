<p>The NETBudget database calculates the budget for each year from the total annual expenses deducted from the total annual income</p>
    <p>Both income and expense values can be of differing rates</p>
    <h3>Installation and Build</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this directory to a folder on your computer</li>
        <li>From a console run the 'dotnet build' command on that folder to construct a database for the calculator to use</li>
        <li>Run 'dotnet run'. This should create a html page at 'http://localhost:57372' through which you can use the application</li>
    </ol>
